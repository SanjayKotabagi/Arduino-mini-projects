Requirements : 

Arduino uno * 1
LED * 1
jumper wires * 2

----------------------------------------------------

Connection :

+LED  ----> Arduino pin 6
-LED  ----> Arduino pin GND

----------------------------------------------------

Working :

First thing is to decalre the variable so that they can universally used anywhere.
led is connected to pin 6.
brightness is var that is used to maintain the brightnss of LED
fadeAmount is var that is used to control the fading of led.

setup() --> is the main function which runs only once after power supply to arduino till power is cut off & in setup we declare which pin used to do which type of work like input/output


loop() --> led is connected to analog pin 6 so that power can be supplied in curved wavelenth,
	created loop so that the fading goes until power is cut off..
	You can change the duration taking to fade by changing value inside dealy().
